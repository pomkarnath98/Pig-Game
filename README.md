# Pig-Game
GAME RULES:
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score.
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- Players can set the Target to the input field, so that they can set their targets.(In case of empty input field, the Target is 100 by default).
- The first player to reach the Target on GLOBAL score wins the game.
